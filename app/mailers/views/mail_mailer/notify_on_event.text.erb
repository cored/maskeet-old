Dear maskeet user,
 
For safety reasons, the maskeet website does not store passwords in clear.
When you forget your password, maskeet creates a new one that can be used in place.
 
You can now connect to your maskeet profile with:
 
nickname: <%= @user %>
password: <%= @user.password %>
 
To get connected, go to the login page (http://www.maskeet-project.com/login)
and enter these codes.
 
We hope to see you soon on maskeet!
